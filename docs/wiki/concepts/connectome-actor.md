## Contract

System observations enter sensory neurons, goal and SAPG exploration conditioning enter descending neurons, and only motor-neuron state is decoded into 29 robot actions. The biological CSR values are fixed; neuron-level incoming/outgoing gains, leak, bias, adapters, and heads provide constrained plasticity.

The privileged asymmetric critic remains the standard SimToolReal MLP and never consumes connectome state.

## Dynamics

For each environment step the actor applies

\[
h_{t+1}=(1-\alpha)\odot h_t+\alpha\odot\tanh\left(0.9e^p\odot\left[W(e^q\odot h_t)\right]+B_sx_t^{sens}+B_gx_t^{goal}+b\right).
\]

`W` is the fixed destination-by-source CSR operator normalized to spectral radius one. Incoming and outgoing gains use a bounded log-space parameterization in `[0.25, 4]` and initialize at one. Leak is sigmoid-parameterized and initializes at `0.5`; recurrent bias initializes at zero. Sparse recurrence is always FP32, including under mixed-precision PPO.

## Trainable parameters

The primary SAPG actor has 109,796 trainable scalars in 12 parameter tensors:

| Group | Shape | Count |
| --- | --- | ---: |
| sensory adapter | `232 x 128` | 29,696 |
| descending adapter | `1236 x 44` | 54,384 |
| incoming neuron gains | `4310` | 4,310 |
| outgoing neuron gains | `4310` | 4,310 |
| neuron leaks | `4310` | 4,310 |
| recurrent biases | `4310` | 4,310 |
| motor action readout weight and bias | `29 x 130`, `29` | 3,799 |
| actor value-head weight and bias | `1 x 4310`, `1` | 4,311 |
| six SAPG embeddings | `6 x 32` | 192 |
| six coefficient-conditioned log standard deviations | `6 x 29` | 174 |
| **Total** | | **109,796** |

The 118,920 biological weights, CSR row/column indices, and population masks are fixed checkpoint buffers, not optimizer parameters. In the frozen-core ablation the gain, leak, and recurrent-bias vectors are also frozen, leaving 92,556 trainable actor scalars. Biological, rewired, and random neuron-gain actors have the same parameter count.

The unchanged asymmetric central critic is separate. It has 2,037,769 trainable scalars: a 194-dimensional input (162 privileged state values plus a 32-dimensional SAPG embedding), the `1024, 1024, 512, 512` MLP, its scalar value output, and six learned SAPG embeddings. The actor-side value head is still optimized because this repository defaults `use_experimental_cv` to true while also training the central critic.

## Adaptation versus LoRA

The neuron-gain plasticity is not standard LoRA. LoRA applies an additive low-rank update, usually written

\[
W_{effective}=W+BA.
\]

Such an update can change an individual connection's sign and, unless explicitly masked, create effective connections wherever the base matrix is zero. The connectome actor instead uses

\[
W_{effective}=\operatorname{diag}(g_{in})W\operatorname{diag}(g_{out}),
\]

so an existing edge from source neuron `j` to destination neuron `i` is multiplied by the positive factor `g_in[i] * g_out[j]`. This is closer to a multiplicative diagonal adapter such as IA3 than to LoRA. It preserves the exact zero/nonzero graph, every edge direction, and every transmitter-derived sign; it cannot introduce a new edge. It also forces all outputs of one source and all inputs of one destination to share gain factors instead of learning 118,920 independent synaptic changes.

These structural safeguards do not prove functional preservation. Each gain is bounded to `[0.25, 4]`, but their product permits an existing edge to range from `0.0625` to `16` times its base magnitude. Learned leaks can approach zero or one, recurrent biases and dense input adapters are not bounded, and strong drives can saturate `tanh`. The fixed base operator has spectral radius one, while the gained effective operator need not. The extracted connectome is measured anatomy and signed synaptic strength, not a pretrained executable controller for the robot, so there is no established robot-control policy whose behavior can be guaranteed unchanged.

The frozen-core profile is the strict structural-dynamics control: recurrent weights, gains, leaks, and recurrent bias all remain at their initialized values while the cross-species input adapters and robot action/value heads learn. For a conservative trainable-core experiment, narrow the gain interval, bound leak and bias deviations, penalize log gains and deviations from initial leak/bias, warm up adapters and readouts with the recurrent core frozen, and monitor effective spectral radius and activation saturation before gradually unfreezing the core. A topology-preserving LoRA-like extension would apply a masked multiplicative modulation such as `W * exp(U V^T)` only on existing edges and regularize it toward identity; an unmasked additive `W + BA` would violate the biological support and sign invariants.

Policy observations `0:125` and `137:140` form the 128-dimensional sensory input. Observations `125:137` form the 12-dimensional goal input. SAPG's learned 32-dimensional coefficient embedding is concatenated with the goal before the descending-neuron adapter. The 130 motor-neuron states alone feed the 29-dimensional action-mean head. Action log standard deviations remain coefficient-conditioned.

## Robot-to-connectome interface

The connectome is a recurrent wiring prior, not a literal fly sensor-to-muscle controller. Learned dense adapters establish the cross-species interface; PPO trains these adapters and the robot readout from task reward.

The environment concatenates its 140 policy observations in this order:

| Indices | Size | Quantity | Connectome route |
| --- | ---: | --- | --- |
| `0:29` | 29 | normalized arm and hand joint positions | sensory adapter |
| `29:58` | 29 | arm and hand joint velocities | sensory adapter |
| `58:87` | 29 | previous joint-position targets | sensory adapter |
| `87:90` | 3 | palm position | sensory adapter |
| `90:94` | 4 | palm quaternion | sensory adapter |
| `94:98` | 4 | object quaternion | sensory adapter |
| `98:113` | 15 | five fingertip positions relative to the palm | sensory adapter |
| `113:125` | 12 | four object keypoints relative to the palm | sensory adapter |
| `125:137` | 12 | four object keypoints relative to the goal | descending adapter |
| `137:140` | 3 | object scale | sensory adapter |

Thus the learned sensory matrix has shape `232 x 128`. It mixes the 128 selected robot features into drives for the 232 biological sensory neurons. The learned descending matrix has shape `1236 x 44`: 12 goal-error features plus SAPG's 32-dimensional exploration embedding drive the 1,236 descending neurons. There is no claimed one-to-one homology between a robot joint and a fly neuron.

After one recurrent update, the runtime gathers only the 130 biological motor-neuron states. A learned `29 x 130` linear readout produces the Gaussian policy mean for seven arm commands and 22 hand commands. The coefficient-conditioned log standard deviation supplies exploration during training; the sampled action is clipped to `[-1, 1]` before entering the environment.

The 29 policy outputs are normalized commands rather than joint angles. With the preserved default controller, the first seven are velocity-like increments from the previous arm target:

\[
\hat q^{arm}_{t+1}=\operatorname{clip}\left(q^{target}_t+1.5\,\Delta t\,a^{arm}_t, q_{min}, q_{max}\right),
\]

followed by the configured moving average. The final 22 commands are mapped linearly from `[-1, 1]` to each hand joint's physical limits and then smoothed and clamped. Isaac Gym receives the resulting 29-vector as its DOF position target. Observation and action delay queues remain those of the original SimToolReal environment.
